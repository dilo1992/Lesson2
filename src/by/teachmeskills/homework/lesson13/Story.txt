Once I sat and sat, and for no reason at all suddenly thought up such a thing that I was even surprised myself. 
I thought how nice it would be if everything around the world was arranged the other way around. 
Well, for example, for children to be in charge in all matters and adults should have to obey them in everything, in everything. 
In general, adults should be like children, and children like adults. That would be great, it would be very interesting.
